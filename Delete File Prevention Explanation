This code is a Windows kernel-mode driver that implements a file deletion filter. It intercepts file delete operations and logs the path of the deleted file.
Let's break down the code into different sections:


  **Header inclusion:**
ntifs.h includes various NT kernel mode definitions and functions.
fltKernel.h includes Filter Manager definitions and functions.

  ** Function prototypes: **
DriverEntry: Entry point function for the driver.
FileDeleteDriverUnload: Driver unload callback function.
FileDeleteFilterPreOperation: Pre-operation callback for file delete operations.
FileDeleteFilterUnload: Unload callback for the minifilter.

  **Global variables:**
Callbacks[]: Array of operation callbacks, only contains one entry for "IRP_MJ_SET_INFORMATION" major function.
The callback is registered to be called before any set information operation on a file object.
The actual implementation is in the FileDeleteFilterPreOperation function defined later in the code.
This allows interception of file delete operations specifically when setting certain information (e.g., deleting files).
Filter registration:
c
Copy code

const FLT_REGISTRATION FilterRegistration = {
    sizeof(FLT_REGISTRATION),
    FLT_REGISTRATION_VERSION,
    0,
    NULL,
    Callbacks,
    FileDeleteFilterUnload,
    NULL // InstanceSetupCallback is not used
};

This structure defines how our minifilter interacts with Filter Manager by providing necessary details like version, callbacks, etc.
Driver entry point (DriverEntry) implementation:
Registers our minifilter using FltRegisterFilter function provided by Filter Manager API.
If registration succeeds, starts filtering I/O operations using FltStartFiltering function.
  
Sets up driver unload callback (FileDeleteDriverUnload) to be called when the driver is unloaded.

If any of these steps fail, appropriate error messages are printed.

Pre-operation callback (FileDeleteFilterPreOperation) implementation:

This callback intercepts file delete operations and logs the path of deleted files.
It checks if the operation is a set information operation and whether it's setting file disposition information (i.e., deleting a file).
If so, it extracts the path from FltObjects->FileObject -> FileName and logs it.
Filter unload callback (FileDeleteFilterUnload) implementation:
Unregisters the minifilter using FltUnregisterFilter function when called.
Driver unload callback (FileDeleteDriverUnload) implementation: The empty function just serves as a placeholder for future use.
